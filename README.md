# dotfiles
Syncing my dotfiles. I'm primarily using https://jooooel.com/sync-dotfiles-using-git/ as my guide

All the dotfiles start with an underscore so that they aren't hidden when I'm in the repo. This makes `ls` work a lot nicer. 

To install the dotfiles, simply link them

```bash
ln -nfs /Users/jq/dotfiles/_vimrc /Users/jq/.vimrc
```
